we will add one route file "urls.py" in every application and connect it to main route by include
also, we need to add a controller file "views.py" in Main project (in laravel we call this controller "MainController")

 
1. Go to "My_Blog_Project" --> My_Blog_Project --> "urls.py" main route file, add 3 path line

	from   django.urls import path, include
	from  .  import views  //add views(controller) of main project

	urlpatterns = [
		path('', views.Index, name='index'),
		path('account/', include('App_Login.urls')),  //connect to App_Login urls
		path('blog/', include('App_Blog.urls'))  //connect to App_Blog urls
	]

2. Go to "My_Blog_Project" --> My_Blog_Project, and create a file "views.py" 
	
	My_Blog_Project
		|
		|----My_Blog_Project
			|---views.py
			|

  open "views.py" and type below code:

	from django.http import HttpResponse  //import http
	
	def  Index(request):
		return HttpResponse("I am home page")


3. create a route file "urls.py" in "App_Login"
4. create a route file "urls.py" in "App_Blog"

   open urls.py of App_Login and type below code
   ---------------------------------
   
   form django.urls import path

	urlpatterns = [

	]


open urls.py of App_Blog and type below code
   ---------------------------------
   
   form django.urls import path

	urlpatterns = [

	]
