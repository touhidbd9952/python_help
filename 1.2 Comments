/////Comments starts with  #///////
  #This is a comment
  print("Hello, World!")

//////multi line comments//////////
Python does not have syntax for multi line comments.
To add a multiline comment you could insert  # for each line:

  #This is a comment
  #written in
  #more than just one line
  print("Hello, World!")
